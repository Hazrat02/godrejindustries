								<h6>A poem by his brother, <br>Nadir Godrej, <br>on his 70th birthday</h6>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row mo_txt_centr">
							<div class="col-md-5">
								<p>A decade is a great event Especially when it’s well spent! And gratefully we do thank heaven That Adi’s celebrating seven.</p>
								<p>Adi to me is an elder brother, For good advice, there was no other. He always took the greatest care And in all things was very fair.</p>
								<p>At school he was extremely smart, Excelled in all, except for art. For fame he never seemed to hanker, In SSC he was first ranker. Then Xavier’s college up to Inter. Then he had to contend with winter. As his next step was MIT, Where, when just twenty-one, you see, He was both Bachelor and Master. And few have ever done it faster!</p>
								<p>Once back home he started work. No matter what he’d never shirk, Just two crore was then the size. Adi set out to modernize-MBA’s were soon recruited And cars for managers were mooted. The marketing was revamped, And those who couldn’t change decamped. He introduced cost accounting And soon the sales started mounting. But hair dye was his greatest coup And over the years, it grew and grew.</p>
								<p>The nineties then brought quite a change The landscape now seemed very strange-With multinationals at the door We hardly knew what was in store. Pepsi and Coke bought all in sight. Should we sell or should we fight? We chose a path that’s in between. In hindsight now it can be seen That Indian firms that learnt to hone Their skills, easily held their own.</p>
								<p>But then we thought that we should seek Strong partners or we would stay weak. And so we formed the odd joint-venture, Which proved to be quite an adventure, We learnt a lot and that’s for sure. It helps us still to endure. But when we got our business back We were rather off the track. But he was ready for the fight. And very soon he set things right.</p>
								<p>Though Godrej Soaps began to soar On market price we couldn’t score. Then our advisors thought it fit That Godrej Soaps should be split.</p>
								<p>GCPL came in to being. And Adi, very quickly seeing, The trend for better governance, Put in to place all at once, With lots of help from CII, Best practices that surely vie With the very best in the world. When our new stock was unfurled, It very soon began to fly And to this day it still stays high.</p>
								<p>Is his success because of skill, Or is it more his iron will? For Adi was always organized And punctuality was prized. By dusk his desk is very neat, His paperwork is all complete. Not agonizing is the trick, Decisions must be very quick.</p>
								<p>Although it now seems like a steal When Kotak offered him the deal, At no low price, but eighty crore, He had a week, no less no more. There was no time for diligence. With courage and intelligence He very quickly clinched the deal, Relying on his good gut feel. Not that he threw away all caution. He took the brilliant precaution Of ensuring he bought good wares By selling a small chunk of shares To Kotak and the firm’s M.D. Ah! What a clever strategy!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-2">
								<p>And with this move so swift and bold The company came in our fold. And over time this company Well known as Godrej-Sara Lee Became a star within the group. For Adi this was such a scoop. And by and by when Sara-Lee Decided it would like to be An exclusively food company. We bought the shares of Sara Lee. We called it first GHPL, Soon merged it with GCPL. Since we had made a beeline To very quickly buying Keyline We got to know of other firms, Whose selling owners liked our terms. So Rapidol came in our fold And that success made us quite bold.</p>
								<p>All over Africa we spread With Darling we now forge ahead. And very soon our eyes went starry And so we bought Megasari! And LatAm also came our way With Argencos and Issue. The developing world’s our playing ground A strategy that we find sound. And Adi never seems to tire With frequent visits to the empire!</p>
								<p>Adi can’t stand the status quo All novel things he wants to know. And if he thinks that it is right He puts in all his will and might Behind the new initiative And with support that he can give We quickly learn the latest ways, Make sure the group sees better days.</p>
								<p>But while he strives for the group The industry is in the loop. He’s always ready to lend a hand, Be President or take a stand With government on policy And he’ll persist till industry Gets exactly what it needs. And now he heads CII And I am sure it will fly high. Thus with conviction Adi leads. All who see him are inspired.</p>
								<p>For all he does, he’s never tired Where does he get the energy? It’s really not a mystery, Adi of course, is very fit. He doesn’t seem to want to sit. There’s not a sport, he hasn’t tried For he can even paraglide. He really loves to water-ski, Not on a lake but on the sea. And on a trip to Mt. Kailash, Although conditions were quite harsh, The mount was circled in a day. Most folks his age would say, “No way”. And none of us can fail to see That he is full of energy. He has set a rapid pace As he leads us in the race. Though all of us most surely know That we have many miles to go But still we’re sure it can be done. Indeed this race must be won.</p>
								<p>And if we stay on the proper way And never let our values sway, If all of us fulfill our roles We will surely reach our goals. A billion Indians, we can say, Will use our product every day And every where it will be seen That we are great, good and green.</p>
								<p>Now hearing praise can be quite tough, I’m sure by now he’s had enough. But all the same why don’t we stand And then give him a rousing hand?</p>

								<p>Sandeep Murthy is founder and managing director of Lightbox, a Mumbai based venture capital firm that invests in early stage technology-led consumer focused ventures. Founded in 2014, Lightbox has raised $400 million across three funds and has backed leading consumer brands such as Nua, Furlenco, Zeno Health, Rebel Foods, Waycool, Bombay Shirt Company and Amaha.</p>
								<p>Murthy is a builder of India’s flourishing consumer internet economy. In a career spanning more than two decades, he has changed lanes from investment banking to entrepreneurship to eventually, venture capital. His venture capital journey started in 2005 with leading investments for Silicon Valley based Sherpalo Ventures in iconic consumer internet companies such as Info Edge and InMobi. He also played a central role in scaling online travel platform Cleartrip, a Sherpalo portfolio company, as its CEO for three years.</p>
								<p>In 2014, when new-age consumer brands started to emerge as challengers to incumbent players, Murthy decided to build a differentiated venture capital firm to address that opportunity and Lightbox was born. His early experiences, which included founding and selling a US-based digital music management startup to Sony Music, became the foundation for Lightbox’s hands-on, deep engagement investment philosophy. The firm’s willingness to apply a private equity style engagement model to venture capital differentiates it from peers and drives value for investors. “We are betting on our ability to not just pick companies but work with them to create value,” he says.</p>
								<p>Investing in startups, for Sandeep, presents an opportunity to work at solving hard problems that have the potential to exponentially impact large markets. When evaluating a startup, he looks for entrepreneurs who have unique insights into a market, are tenacious enough to turn those insights into viable solutions and an ability to think outside the box, while still working in a disciplined and structured fashion.</p>
								<p>Murthy studied engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and completed his MBA from The Wharton School.</p>
						<!-- <p>As an early investor in InMobi and InfoEdge, two of India’s billion-dollar technology companies, Sandeep Murthy is one of the builders of India’s internet economy. He has not only witnessed the highs and lows as an investor but also held operational roles, including a three-year tenure as the CEO of Cleartrip starting 2006. </p>
						<p>A dreamer from the start, who doesn’t believe in choosing between ‘this or that’, he pursued undergraduate degrees in both business and engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Following this, he delved into investment banking during the peak of the dot.com boom, but with a twist – he relocated to Palo Alto, California to join CSFB Technology Group. </p>
						<p>He teamed up with a friend to build a digital music company incubated by Sony Music, which they subsequently sold to Sony after the Internet bubble burst. Sandeep lived the Bay Area dream for a few years before moving to New York to join InterActive Corp (IAC), the parent company of Expedia, TicketMaster, and Home Shopping Network, where he played a key role in launching Gifts.com. He then turned his attention to the technology opportunities in India, eventually moving to Mumbai to oversee investments for Sherpalo Ventures, a fund based out of Menlo Park in California.</p>
						<p>Today, Sandeep is a co-founder and partner at Lightbox, a Mumbai-based venture capital firm that invests in Indian consumer technology companies. Lightbox has secured over $380 Million from leading institutional investors. Recent investments include Droom, Rebel Foods, Furlenco and AI-platform Embibe, which secured a $185 Million investment commitment from Reliance, India's leading internet conglomerate. This represents the largest AI investment in edtech globally. Sandeep is also involved with platforms like Magic Bus, a non-profit organisation that uses activity-based curricula to teach life skills underprivileged children. He devotes most of his time to pioneering unprecedented initiatives. Known for his all-in, nothing-held-back approach, Sandeep thrives on immersing himself in the heart of the matters, experimenting with new ideas, and involving as many people as possible. In a somewhat unpredictable market, his investment success is rooted in a blend of profound product intuition and unconventional thinking.</p> -->

								<p>Sandeep Murthy is founder and managing director of Lightbox, a Mumbai based venture capital firm that invests in early stage technology-led consumer focused ventures. Founded in 2014, Lightbox has raised $400 million across three funds and has backed leading consumer brands such as Nua, Furlenco, Zeno Health, Rebel Foods, Waycool, Bombay Shirt Company and Amaha.</p>
								<p>Murthy is a builder of India’s flourishing consumer internet economy. In a career spanning more than two decades, he has changed lanes from investment banking to entrepreneurship to eventually, venture capital. His venture capital journey started in 2005 with leading investments for Silicon Valley based Sherpalo Ventures in iconic consumer internet companies such as Info Edge and InMobi. He also played a central role in scaling online travel platform Cleartrip, a Sherpalo portfolio company, as its CEO for three years.</p>
								<p>In 2014, when new-age consumer brands started to emerge as challengers to incumbent players, Murthy decided to build a differentiated venture capital firm to address that opportunity and Lightbox was born. His early experiences, which included founding and selling a US-based digital music management startup to Sony Music, became the foundation for Lightbox’s hands-on, deep engagement investment philosophy. The firm’s willingness to apply a private equity style engagement model to venture capital differentiates it from peers and drives value for investors. “We are betting on our ability to not just pick companies but work with them to create value,” he says.</p>
								<p>Investing in startups, for Sandeep, presents an opportunity to work at solving hard problems that have the potential to exponentially impact large markets. When evaluating a startup, he looks for entrepreneurs who have unique insights into a market, are tenacious enough to turn those insights into viable solutions and an ability to think outside the box, while still working in a disciplined and structured fashion.</p>
								<p>Murthy studied engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and completed his MBA from The Wharton School.</p>
								<!-- <p>As an early investor in InMobi and InfoEdge, two of India’s billion-dollar technology companies, Sandeep Murthy is one of the builders of India’s internet economy. He has not only witnessed the highs and lows as an investor but also held operational roles, including a three-year tenure as the CEO of Cleartrip starting 2006. </p>
								<p>A dreamer from the start, who doesn’t believe in choosing between ‘this or that’, he pursued undergraduate degrees in both business and engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Following this, he delved into investment banking during the peak of the dot.com boom, but with a twist – he relocated to Palo Alto, California to join CSFB Technology Group. </p>
								<p>He teamed up with a friend to build a digital music company incubated by Sony Music, which they subsequently sold to Sony after the Internet bubble burst. Sandeep lived the Bay Area dream for a few years before moving to New York to join InterActive Corp (IAC), the parent company of Expedia, TicketMaster, and Home Shopping Network, where he played a key role in launching Gifts.com. He then turned his attention to the technology opportunities in India, eventually moving to Mumbai to oversee investments for Sherpalo Ventures, a fund based out of Menlo Park in California.</p>
								<p>Today, Sandeep is a co-founder and partner at Lightbox, a Mumbai-based venture capital firm that invests in Indian consumer technology companies. Lightbox has secured over $380 Million from leading institutional investors. Recent investments include Droom, Rebel Foods, Furlenco and AI-platform Embibe, which secured a $185 Million investment commitment from Reliance, India's leading internet conglomerate. This represents the largest AI investment in edtech globally. Sandeep is also involved with platforms like Magic Bus, a non-profit organisation that uses activity-based curricula to teach life skills underprivileged children. He devotes most of his time to pioneering unprecedented initiatives. Known for his all-in, nothing-held-back approach, Sandeep thrives on immersing himself in the heart of the matters, experimenting with new ideas, and involving as many people as possible. In a somewhat unpredictable market, his investment success is rooted in a blend of profound product intuition and unconventional thinking.</p> -->
